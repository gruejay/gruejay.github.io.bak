I received my bachelor of science degrees in mathematics and computer science from the University
of Maryland in May 2020. I went on to receive a master of arts in philosophy from Carnegie Mellon University 
in August 2022. My research was in ethics and political philosophy, focusing in particular on the ethical 
conseuqneces of our beliefs.
